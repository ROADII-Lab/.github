# ROADII-Lab

ROADII-Lab  has been developed by the Intelligent Transportation Systems Joint Program Office of the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT) with the purpose of disseminating comprehensive information and resources pertaining to advanced data analytics use cases within the transportation domain. Given the continuous evolution of data analytics techniques, it is imperative for state and local agencies to gain a profound understanding of the relevant use cases, their implementation and operationalization possibilities, and the comparative benefits of various options. The Github repository serves as an invaluable resource, empowering transportation practitioners to enhance the safety and efficiency of their transportation systems.

ROADII-Lab is a product of ITS JPO's Research, Operational and AI Data Integration Initiative (ROADII), which is focused on identifying transportation use cases that might be solved through innovative and advanced data analytics techniques. ROADII includes a virtual laboratory collective consisting of an internal development team along with state and local stakeholders and other research institutions.
